### How to contribute

We trust thast you will not copy this idea/project, this is at the end for the sake of Allah and we all have goof intentions while working with this project . But we must stress that copying the code/ project is unacceptable.

### Running the app locally

- Ensure you have the latest `nodejs` and `npm` installed. Prefer 10+. 
- Ensure you have `yarn` installed. Simply `npm i -g yarn`.
- Clone this repo.
- Run `yarn` on the repo to install `node_modules`.

The app runs on next.js and will automatically hot  reload when you make changes.

### Environment variables

### DLS( design language system)
One mistake we made previously is treated each component as unique. This made our work not scalable . Secondly, when looking at large companies, they often devvelop a desiogn style language that can be used across the app without the nedd to create unique components and ensure better c onsistency across the product. We are trying to take the similar approach. If somnething can be used elewhere, please put it inside the `dls/` directory and create stories for it.

### Storybook.js
Our components are build within Storybook.js . See files with the name `.stories.tsx` . This helps engineers view their work outside the product, making it super easy to test different cofigurations of the components.
